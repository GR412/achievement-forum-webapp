## About

This serves as the front-end of a forum web application that allows users to make posts around video game achievements.
This will include; posting tips and guides, posting partner searches for achievements that require 
other people and events for achievements that require a large number of people. All major platforms, including;
Steam, Xbox and Playstation will have their own sections.

[Here is the back-end part](https://github.com/SneakyShrike/achievement-forum-api) of the web app that compliments this.
